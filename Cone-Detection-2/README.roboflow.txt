The dataset includes 368 images.
Cones are annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Resize to 720x720 (Fill (with center crop))

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise
